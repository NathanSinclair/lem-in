## This project is meant to make you code a digital version of an ant farm.	

Create a program lem-in that will read from a file (describing the ants and the colony) given in the arguments.	

Upon successfully finding the quickest path, lem-in will display the content of the file passed as argument and each move the ants make from room to room.
